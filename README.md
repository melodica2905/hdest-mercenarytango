## Mercenary Tango
A small addon ment to be used with Accensus's Mercenary Merchant addon (https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/merchant/-/tree/mercenary)

It will randomly spawn a Tango on any map that has a deathmatch start in it, notifying the player, and if the Tango is killed, they'll drop their weaponry, extra goodies, and money to use with the merchant.
